        <h3>Scenario</h3>    
          <p>On February 1st, Dr. Sarah Chen, a tenured Psychology professor, requested development of a new online graduate course “Advanced Statistical Methods for Social Sciences” (PSYC 7850) launching August 28th. She has fifteen years of teaching experience but no online course development background. Currently teaching three courses per semester while managing two research projects, her availability is limited to Tuesdays 2-4 PM and Thursdays 10 AM-12 PM. She takes a two-week Europe research trip in mid-June and has reduced availability after July 15th due to conference season.</p>
          <p>The 15-week, 3-credit course targets twenty graduate students from various psychology programs. Delivered fully asynchronous with optional synchronous office hours, assessments include research papers, group projects, weekly problem sets, and exams. Students must use SPSS and R programming languages.</p>
          <p>Dr. Chen’s extensive requests include fifteen weeks of learning modules with readings and activities, about 50 video lectures covering statistical concepts, interactive SPSS and R labs, virtual collaboration spaces, custom simulation tools, automated grading systems, comprehensive test banks, mobile-responsive materials, real-world dataset integration, virtual office hours platform, accessibility features, and supplementary practice exercises with immediate feedback.</p>  
          <p>Additional complications include her interest in cutting-edge machine learning content she’s still researching, potential guest expert interviews, limited departmental budget for external tools, required professional video captioning, IT department’s two-week turnaround for LMS requests, her inexperience with online learning objectives and assessments, and concerns about academic integrity.</p>
          <p>Institutional constraints include spring break closure (March 18-25), summer session with reduced staffing (May 15-July 31), a beneficial faculty development workshop (April 10-11), and annual LMS maintenance shutdown (June 15-17).</p>
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Project scope statement: Outline the extent of the project, its deliverables and their responsible parties.</li>
            <li>Project timeline: Provide all parties with a visual representation of the project timeline, along with deadlines for each project deliverable.</li>
          </ol>
